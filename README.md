# DEIS Course Project Description

* Basic idea: 
One of the greatest threats to the continued existence of humans is illnesses, like in the massive effects we have seen this year due to the COVID-19 disease. We imagine that COVID has struck again, this time in Halmstad in the year 2040, when autonomous vehicles drive the streets. You will develop semi-autonomous robots that will travel throughout a city mockup in platoons and navigate through intersection crossings in a safe way, including emergency vehicles. 

* Basic motivation: This topic relates broadly to the School of Information Technology’s focuses on autonomous vehicles in smart cities/platooning and health technology; by considering this project topic, we hope to help prepare HH students to do research and development in designing embedded and intelligent systems related to autonomous vehicles and/or health technology. Additiona expected outcomes are that we will prepare an academic paper together summarizing some of the results of the course (the “research steps”) and a Youtube video that can be used as a demo for th “SafeSmart” research project.

* Groups: Students should try to form groups with a mixture of useful knowledge in embedded systems, intelligent systems, communication, etc, with a similar level of knowledge/expectations for grades. Students will get the chance to form their own groups but the course responsible can reassign group members as required.

* Setup: Each carlike robot will have infrared light sensor arrays pointed downwards to follow tracks, a forward-facing camera to do more complex sensing, and encoders attached to its wheel shafts. Two motors power the robot’s wheels. Processing will be conducted with a microcontroller (Arduino) for low level tasks, and a small computer (Raspberry Pi) running Linux with Wifi for some higher level tasks. Communication will be conducted using a predetermined protocol, running on robot operating system (ROS), which is designed to handle cases with multiple robots sending much information, on our own network, which is not connected to the internet. Groups can choose to add other sensors, actuators, computers, etc. (“eduroam” can be used to download software.)  The robots will run on top of a 1.8 x 2.4 meter table on E1, equipped with “tracks” made from black tape. The students this year will make a city section (with materials like cardboard) to drive around in. There will probably also be some flying robots (toy drones) with a camera.


## Tollgate 1
The main aim of tollgate 1 is to understand the concepts learnt during the labs and the lectures and utilize them into system modeling.

> System modeling constitutes understanding functional and non-functional requirements; connecting requirements to system design.
